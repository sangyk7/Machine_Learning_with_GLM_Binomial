In case of  "Evaluation of Movie Recommendation System with RMSE", 
I analyzed for 2 different datasets - 100K and  10M 
due  to  the following 2 reasons.

1. to check if this program can work for the big dataset.
2. to check if the RMSE will decrease as the number of data increases.

The result is as follows.

Number of data      RMSE
100K                0.8806419   
10M                 0.8659626

The RMSE decreased as the number of data increased here.
